# Dijkstra-Algorithm-for-Path-Planning
Dijkstra Algorithm for path planning 

Steps to Run the code:

1. Download the file "dijkstra_akhil_javvadi.py" file in your editor

2. Run the code

3. Give the x and y input coordinates separately in the terminal.  
ex: Enter the start position..
    Enter your value for x-axis: ('enter value here')
    Similarlly with y-axis and goal position

    Case 1
    example inputs are: Start Node:
                        x-axis: 20
                        y-axis: 20
                        Goal Node:
                        x-axis: 200
                        y-axis: 400
    Case 2
    example inputs are: Start Node:
                        x-axis: 400
                        y-axis: 300
                        Goal Node:
                        x-axis: 1150
                        y-axis: 50
     

Libraries used:
1. Numpy: used for basic linear algrbra, mathematical logics, arrays. 
2. cv2: this is a computer vision library, open cv functions
3. Heapq: used for various operations on a heap data structure.
